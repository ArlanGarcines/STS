            <h2>Salvador Trade School History</h2>
            <img src="image/STS-Map.png" width="1000">
            <p> &emsp;&emsp; Nineteen Hundred and Sixty Five (1965), during one of the routinary visit of the late
                Congressman Laurentino Badelles, Ex-mayor Antonio Abadiano an Agricultural Graduate from Central Luzon
                Agricultural College requested the said congressman to established an Agricultural School in Salvador,
                Lanao del Norte so that sons and daughters of poor farmers can be given a secondary education with less
                expenses, technically trained, cheap but profitable. </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; Because of the abundance of water supply in Inasagan and Cabongbongan springs, now Camp
                Allere the populace was unanimously recommending said place for the school site. Before congressman
                Badelles left for Iligan city, he instructed mayor Abadiano to secure the approval of the proposed
                school site while he will continue with the Draft of his Bill. </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; Though the purpose was good and noble, the people were reluctant to part with their land,
                even if it will be paid by the government. They have strived hard and overcome all difficulties so that
                their love ones can claim a land at their very own. </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; Be that as it may, the draft of the bill was post through minus the school site. Congressman
                Badelles was only too eager and interested to amend the bill as only eight hectares will be required.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; On January 1965, Congressman Badelles sponsored House Bill No. 8376 which easily passed the
                3rd reading in both houses of the congress and the senate. Though house bill no. 8376 was approved with
                enabling Act 04440 on June 19, 1965 its implementation was delayed. Politicians come and go and mayor
                Abadiano was relieved by ex-mayor Apolonio Yap who wanted to open the Trade School. But Father Reilly
                with a private school requested that if a government school be opened he be allowed to graduate his
                first fourth year students as he has spent plenty of money for the construction of said school. Mayor
                Yap was again relieved by Mayor Pangantapan Tawantawan. Situation then in Salvador had greatly changed.
                Prices of commodities had gone up that even the matriculation and tuition fees were raised. Then how can
                the sons and daughters of the poor farmers around pursue a secondary education? </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; Civic minded citizens of Salvador grouped together for a meeting with the issue of
                establishing a government secondary school in the municipality and all agreed that the Municipal Council
                petition Congressman Dimaporo to set aside funds for the opening of a Trade School. </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; The Salvador Trade School, Salvador, Lanao del Norte was formally opened on July 6, 1971.
                The school was pioneered by four teachers and seven support staff with an enrolment of 72 students
                housed temporarily in the Salvador Central Social Hall under the administration of the late
                superintendent Sangki Singayao and under the direct supervision of the principal Pawadji H. Hadja. The
                school has its annual appropriation of P 50,000.00. </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; On August 9, 1971 misunderstanding between Christian and Muslim occurred and people in the
                municipality evacuated to other provinces including students of the school. On August 24, 1971 with the
                discretion of the late superintendent Sangki Sangayao and granted by the director of the Bureau of
                Vocational Education to evacuate the teachers and support staff at Maigo School of Arts and Trades,
                Maigo, Lanao del Norte for safety reasons and to undergo training in their respective duties under the
                supervision of Mr. Maximo Aguaviva, Jr. principal of the said school. </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; The supply officer and other personnel of the school with the carpenters who were left
                behind in Salvador did not lost time in constructing the first building with the aid of the military
                personnel. On October 4, 1971, teachers were recalled at Maranding Elementary School, Maranding, Lala,
                Lanao del Norte to continue their classes with 24 students the remaining among the remnants of the
                evacuees. </p>
            <p>   On January 1972 classes were returned to Salvador Trade School with the employees to occupy the new
                building. The enrolment was only 75 students with an increased only of 3 students as of the beginning.
                The annual appropriation was P 103,035.00.
                In the year 1973-74 the enrolment was increased to 195 students with an annual appropriation of P
                135,265.00. Two building were already constructed. In 1974-1975 the enrollment was again increased to
                225 students with an annual appropriation of P231,567.00. The 2-storey Related Subject Building was
                constructed unfinished.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>   In 1975-76 the enrollment was again increased to 275 students with annual appropriation of P
                274,00.00. One Boys Shop Building of 2-unit prefab building was constructed unfinished with a principal
                cottage unfinished. In 1976-1977 a Girls Trade Building with another 2-unit pre-fab building was
                constructed unfinished with an annual appropriation one half of the previous years appropriation. </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; In 1996-1997 the Salvador Trade School is operating under the National Budget of P
                3,856,124.00 for Personal Services and P 378,504 for Maintenance and other Operating Expenses per annum
                categorized as Technical-Vocational School. It’s funding control and operation is administratively
                supervised by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) Region XII, Cotabato
                City. </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; It offers ten (10) programs as Post-Secondary, Technical Vocational Education Program which
                is administered by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and the modified
                Secondary Education Development Program (SEDP) which is supervised by the Department of Education,
                Culture and Sports (DECS). </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; There were 39 positions with regular appointment of which 16 are administrative supervisory
                and support staffs, 23 are teachers of which 12 of them were utilized to handle the Technical Vocational
                Education Program. For the school year 1997-1998 30 % of the total enrollment is Post-Secondary first
                year and second year respectively. </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; Because of the TESDA Law to separate the secondary education and approved by the GAA to
                fully transfer its secondary enrollees including teaching staff and some personnel who would not qualify
                to the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority. On October 23, 2001 a Memorandum of
                Agreement (MOA) was signed between the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA)
                represented by its Regional Director and the Department of Education represented by the Regional
                Director of the same Region XII. The agreement was to divide the school equally with the 8 hectares of
                land area. </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; The total personnel at present that was retained after the rationalization of TESDA
                administered school, has 12 Teaching staff and 10 Administrative, Supervisory and support staff. Budget
